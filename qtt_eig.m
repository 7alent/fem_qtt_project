%     Consider the generalized eigenvalues problem as
%                         A * x = lambda * B * x
%     where A, B are matrices of size 2^d * 2^d , d is a positive integer
%     and A, B are symmetric, B is postive definite;
%     lambda is the smallest eigenvalue, x is the eigenvector respectly.
%     Throgh the Cholesky decomposition of B = LL', the problem can be 
%     rewrote as
%                           C * y = lambda * y
%     with C = inv(L) * A * inv(L'), y = L' * x .
%     If C is not positive definite, we modify C by subtracting m * I 
%     to C and solve the eigenvalue problem
%                  ( C + m * I ) * y = ( lambda + m ) * y
%     here m can be seen as an estimate of -lambda.
%     Noticed that y is the eigenvector w.r.t. eigenvalue ( lambda + m )
%     of matrix ( C + m * I ) .
%     This problem is solved by transforming the matrix into Quantitized
%     Tensor Train (QTT) format and using Density Matrix Renormalization 
%     Group (DMRG) method, the solution of sparse matrix solver (eigs()) 
%     will also be computed.
%     Tips: lambda obtained by DMRG can be use to tune the parameter m,
%           a simple way is to set m = ceil(-lambda).
